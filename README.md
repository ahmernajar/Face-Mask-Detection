# Face Mask Detection

## Overview
Face Mask Detection is a sophisticated machine learning project designed to identify the presence of face masks on individuals in images. It classifies individuals into three categories: those wearing masks correctly, those wearing masks incorrectly, and those not wearing masks at all. This project achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 13% on its test set, showcasing its accuracy and potential utility in public health initiatives and monitoring systems.

## Features
- **Dataset Provision:** Comes with a pre-defined dataset for training and testing.
- **Model Training:** Includes scripts to train the model on the provided dataset.
- **Mask Detection:** Capable of detecting and classifying mask-wearing conditions.
- **Instance Counting:** Provides a count of detected instances for each mask-wearing condition, offering insights into compliance rates within the observed groups.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates the model using MAPE, among other metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is hosted on Kaggle. It includes images classified into three categories: correctly worn masks, incorrectly worn masks, and no mask. To use the same dataset for training and testing the Face Mask Detection model, follow these steps:

1. Visit the Kaggle dataset page at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection/data. You might need to create an account or log in to access the dataset.
2. Download the dataset to your local machine.
3. Extract the dataset into the `dataset/` directory within the project structure. Ensure the dataset is structured appropriately, as expected by the training script (you may specify the expected structure if necessary).

Please adhere to Kaggle's terms of service and use the dataset respectfully.
